# Linear Regression Analysis  
Practical implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm, exploring its strengths, limitations and enhancements.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This repository demonstrates how Linear Regression works in practice — from first-principles implementation to real-world dataset usage. It highlights when and why Linear Regression may fail, and points to possible improvements (such as regularisation).

## 🔧 What’s Inside  
- `datasets/` – sample data files used in the notebooks.  
- `Student_score_prediction.ipynb` – a simple example: predicting student scores based on explanatory variable(s).  
- `Student_performance_prediction.ipynb` – a more complex dataset: exploring multiple features to predict student performance.  
- `Regularisation.ipynb` – demonstrates how regularisation (Ridge, Lasso) addresses over-fitting in Linear Regression.  
- `.vscode/` – IDE/editor configuration files (optional).  
- `README.md` – this file.

## 📚 Why This Project  
As you advance in AI/ML (which I know you’re passionate about, especially being a 3rd-year CSE student specialising in AI/ML), it’s important to solidify your understanding of foundational algorithms. Linear Regression is one of the first algorithms to grasp — and by implementing it yourself and exploring its drawbacks, you’ll build deeper intuition.

## ✅ Key Features  
- Manual implementation of Linear Regression (rather than just using library calls).  
- Application to real-life style datasets (student scores, performance).  
- Exploration of model limitations (under-fitting, over-fitting) and how to mitigate them via regularisation.  
- Clear step-by-step notebooks that you can follow and extend.

## 🎯 How to Use  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Ritik4259/linear-regression-analysis.git
